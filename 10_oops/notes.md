#javascript and classes
##oject ooiented ppogramming(oop)

##object
-cllection of properties and methods
-tolwerccse,ttouercace 
-een though our promises are also an object

##why use oop
-spagetti code-code gets so messed up that any of its chunk can,t be reused and hence to avoid all this oop came into role

##parts of oop
-object literal

-constructor function
-prototypes
-classes
-instances(new,this)

#4 pillars
-abstraction
-encapsulation
-inheritance
-polymorphism

1. Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It allows programmers to focus on interactions at a high level without needing to understand all the details. For example, when you use a car, you don't need to know how the engine works; you just need to know how to drive it.

2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse. For instance, you might have private variables in a class that can only be accessed through public methods.

3. Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child class) can inherit properties and methods from an existing class (parent class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes. For example, if you have a class Animal, you can create a class Dog that inherits from Animal, gaining its properties and methods.

4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name. This can be achieved through method overriding (in subclasses) or method overloading (same method name with different parameters). For example, a function makeSound() could behave differently for a Dog class and a Cat class.
